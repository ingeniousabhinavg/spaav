                        <h6>Programmes of Study Offered</h6>
                        <p>The undergraduate degree programme was started in the academic year 2008-09 viz., (1). Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) (5 years/10 semesters). The B. Arch degree prepares students for professional practice in the field of Architecture. It provides exposure to a variety of interests in the field while assisting students to discover their own directions for further development. The admissions to B. Arch are made once a year during June-July by the Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB) on the basis of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main, conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), New Delhi. Besides, admission of foreign nationals and Indian students studying abroad can be made to various undergraduate programmes under Direct Admission of Students Abroad (DASA), a scheme of MHRD. The seats under this scheme are over and above the sanctioned seats. SPA Vijayawada has an intake of 75 seats under B. Arch (excluding 15% supernumerary quota under DASA).
                            Addressing Architectural Design as a comprehensive creative process, this programme is based on the following broad intentions: <br>
                            <br>
                            a. To stimulate sensitivity and unveil creative talents; to reinforce intellectual capabilities and develop proficiency in professional skills to enable graduates to competently pursue alternative careers, within the broad spectrum of architecture.
                            <br>
                            b. To provide opportunities to students to try out the role they will eventually play as responsible members of society, under supervision and interactive guidance.
                            <br>
                            c. The programme aims at attaining a high level of excellence in Architectural Design. To this end, the design course is seen as the core of the programme with supportive inputs from courses in other streams viz., the Humanities, the Technological and the Professional, built upon a strong foundation of enabling skills in communications and data processing. The emphasis is on the development of faculties of discernment and decision-making with the aid of both objective information and subjective attitudes, based on reason.
